function [bandPower, powerSpectrum, frequencies] = BandPsd(signalData, samplingRate, frequencyBands)
%% BANDPSD Calculate the power spectral density in specified frequency bands
% Computes power in different frequency bands for a time series signal
%
% Inputs:
%   signalData:       Time series data (LFP or other signal) - must be a vector
%   samplingRate:     Sampling rate in Hz
%   frequencyBands:   nÃ—1 cell array where each cell contains [lowFreq, highFreq]
%                     Example: {[1,4]; [5,8]; [9,12]; [13,30]; [31,70]; [71,150]}
%
% Outputs:
%   bandPower:        Power in each frequency band (in dB)
%   powerSpectrum:    Full power spectral density
%   frequencies:      Frequency vector corresponding to powerSpectrum
